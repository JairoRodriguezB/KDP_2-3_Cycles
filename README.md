# Optimizing Kidney Paired Donation Using Cycles of 2 and 3 Nodes

**Goal**
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The objective of this project is to develop a graph-based optimization model for Kidney Paired Donation (KPD), aiming to maximize compatible donor-recipient matches within cycles of size 2 and 3. By constructing a directed graph based on compatibility rules, detecting feasible cycles, and formulating an optimization problem, the model ensures that each participant is included in at most one cycle. This approach optimizes kidney exchange programs, streamlining logistical coordination for efficient transplantation planning.

**Project Overview**
This project uses Python and graph theory to:
- Build a directed graph representing donor-recipient pairs.
- Identify feasible 2-node and 3-node cycles based on predefined compatibility rules.
- Solve an optimization problem to maximize the number of successful exchanges while ensuring fairness.

**Key Features**
- Data Visualization: Displays recipient blood type distribution and cycle structures.
- Optimization Model: Implements algorithms to detect and maximize compatible cycles.
- Results Analysis: Includes detailed statistics on included vs. excluded nodes and donor-recipient pairing success.

**File Contents**
- KDP_project_JRB.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations for the project.
