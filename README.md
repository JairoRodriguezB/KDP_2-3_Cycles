# Optimizing Kidney Paired Donation Using Cycles of 2 and 3 Nodes

**Goal**
The objective of this project is to develop a graph-based optimization model for Kidney Paired Donation (KPD), aiming to maximize compatible donor-recipient matches within cycles of size 2 and 3. By constructing a directed graph based on compatibility rules, detecting feasible cycles, and formulating an optimization problem, the model ensures that each participant is included in at most one cycle. This approach optimizes kidney exchange programs, streamlining logistical coordination for efficient transplantation planning.
